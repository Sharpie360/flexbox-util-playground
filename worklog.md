# Flexbox Playground Worklog



### Todo
- remove flexgap for single item
- transition for flex items label value
- getting started route
- home route
- set custom width to heights if flexdir = column
- refactor to plus/minus with value in middle button/display group
- more option button?
  - duplicate left
  - duplicate right
  - show flexbox classes
    - figure out how to show
    - parse html for classes containing flex class names?
  - randomize the flex
- mobile layout

- refactor flex-input-group to child component of flex-input-panel, each flex item panel will render as own component tree
  = renders all inputs together inside flex-input-panel, becoming unmaintainable
